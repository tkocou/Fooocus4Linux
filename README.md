# Fooocus4Linux
A script to automate the installation  and update of Fooocus. The script depends on the bash shell.

# Installation:
    Copy the webui.sh to your home directory. Set the executable permissions if needed.
    Then execute in a terminal window from your home directory.  [ $ bash ./webui.sh ]

# AMD GPUs
    When starting webui.sh, add *AMD* to the command like this:  $ bash ./webui.sh AMD
    To make the AMD GPU drivers the default, edit the webui.sh script and make one change
    which is documented in the beginning of the script.
